# Kali-Firewall-Configuration-
Project Overview
This project demonstrates my foundational understanding of network security by configuring a firewall in Kali Linux using UFW rules to control incoming and outgoing traffic. Successfully creating firewall rules strengthens system protection and represents essential cyber defense practices.
Tools & Technologies
Kali Linux (Virtual Machine)
UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) 
VirtualBox

Objective
Understand how firewalls function in a Linux environment

Configure and test firewall rules

Monitor changes in traffic behavior

Steps I Completed

Launched Kali Linux VM in VirtualBox

Update packages 

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

Installed firewall tool (if needed):

sudo apt install ufw

Enabled firewall:
sudo ufw enable
Tested connectivity and observed traffic changes

What I Learned
How Linux manages network traffic at a low level

The importance of default-deny configurations

Basics of system hardening and cyber defense

Reinforced skills in Linux terminal navigation and troubleshooting

Create advanced rules (port-specific filtering)

Combine with packet capture for deeper analysis

Automate firewall configuration using a bash script
